Shared resources for building Newscoop themes

Many themes for the [Newscoop](https://www.sourcefabric.org/en/newscoop/) content management system contain common elements. The purpose of this repository is to collect re-usable resources for theme developers.

In the [translations](translations/) directory you will find YAML files with 100+ common strings from the [Liquid theme](https://github.com/newscoop/theme-Liquid) that can be used in your own theme for Newscoop 4.3 or later. Contributions of re-usable strings are welcome via pull request. Any strings which are unique to a single theme should be added to a separate YAML resource in your theme's translations directory, to save bloating the common resource.
